mobile-detect
=============
![Build probably passing](https://travis-ci.org/ktaragorn/mobile_detect.svg?branch=master)
This is a ruby version of a [php library of the same name](https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect). It uses the exported data provided by that library and hopes to implement a significant subset of the features.
